_Control a FPGA via a Raspberry Pi and a Webserver. As an example, I burned my
[programable-8-bit-microprocessor](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/tree/master/systems/microprocessors/programable-8-bit-microprocessor)
to an FPGA development board and you can control it at
[JeffDecola.com/fpga](http://jeffdecola.com/fpga)._

## OVERVIEW

This project is separated into 3 main sections,

1. The FPGA
2. The Raspberry Pi (go code) to control the I/O of the FPGA
3. The Webserver (bluehost) providing a GUI to control the Raspberry Pi

This may help,

## A LITTLE MORE DETAIL

The following figure provides more details and will be explained
in the following three sections,

![IMAGE - controlling-my-programable-8-bit-microprocessor-from-a-raspi-and-webserver.jpg - IMAGE](docs/pics/controlling-my-programable-8-bit-microprocessor-from-a-raspi-and-webserver.jpg)

## SECTION I - THE FPGA

My
[programable-8-bit-microprocessor](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/tree/master/systems/microprocessors/programable-8-bit-microprocessor)
will be used as an example. Please refer to that repo on how to burn a
FPGA from verilog.

In that repo,

* I designed the 8-bit microprocessor in
  [Verilog](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/development/languages/systemverilog-cheat-sheet)
  (An HDL language)
* Used the
  [Xilinx Vivado](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/synthesis/xilinx-vivado-cheat-sheet)
  IDE to synthesize and burn/flash on boot the FPGA
* Used a
  [Digilent ARTY-S7](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/synthesis/xilinx-vivado-cheat-sheet)
  FPGA development board 

To operate this microprocessor, the Raspberry Pi will,

* Set both inputs [7:0] DATA_IN_A and [7:0] DATA_IN_B
* Select an [3:0] OPCODE instruction (such as ADD)
  * 0011: ADD
  * 0111: SUBTRACT
  * 1100: MULTIPLY
  * 1110: DIVIDE
* Enable the GO_BAR via GO signal
* Observe the resulting [7:0] DATA_OUT

The number of I/O the Raspberry Pi can control is 26 I/O pins.
But as shown in the following figure, the microprocessor has 31 pins.
The next section will go over which 5 pins we hardcoded or will be
controlled by the FPGA development board,

![IMAGE - Top-Level-Block-Diagram-of-the-8-bit-Microprocessor.jpg - IMAGE](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/blob/master/docs/pics/Top-Level-Block-Diagram-of-the-8-bit-Microprocessor.jpg?raw=true)

## SECTION II - THE RASPBERRY PI

The Raspberry Pi shall do two things,

* Control 26 pins of the I/O of the FPGA (GPIO to PMOD)
* Provide an interface to the webserver (REST JSON API)

### PREREQUISITES

I used the following language,

* [go](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/development/languages/go-cheat-sheet)

You will need the following go packages,

```bash
go get -u periph.io/x/periph/cmd/...
```

To build a docker image you will need docker on your machine,

* [docker](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/operations-tools/orchestration/builds-deployment-containers/docker-cheat-sheet)

To push a docker image you will need,

* [DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/)

### RUN

The following steps are located in
[run.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/run.sh).

To run
[main.go](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/main.go)
from the command line,

```bash
cd code
go run main.go
```

### CREATE BINARY

The following steps are located in
[create-binary.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/bin/create-binary.sh).

```bash
cd code
go build -o bin/control-fpga main.go
cd bin
./control-fpga
```

This binary will not be used during a docker build since it creates itâ€™s own.

### RASPBERRY PI TO FPGA DEV BOARD INTERFACE (GPIO to PMOD)

The GPIO (Input/Output) of the Raspberry Pi is connected to the
Input/Output of the FPGA development board via Pmod connectors.
On a side note, it may be a good idea to place a 200 Ohm resister in-line.

All of the GPIOs have weak internal pull-ups and downs which may be enabled
or disabled by software. I control this in my go code.

There are a total of 26 I/O pins that you may use in the Raspberry Pi.
But I have a total of 31 I would like to use.  So I had to compromise
and hardcoded 5 of the Inputs (????).

The Raspberry Pi will connect to the processor as follows,

* **OUTPUT (SET)**
  * [3:0] OPCODE
  * GO_BAR
  * RESET (N/C)
  * JAM (N/C)
  * [7:0] DATA_IN_A (Bits 4,5,6 hardcoded to low)
  * [7:0] DATA_IN_B
* **INPUT (GET)**
  * [7:0] DATA_OUT

A go program is used to control and capture the I/O.

The pin list between the Raspberry Pi and the FPGA development
board is as follows,

|                 | PMOD Pins         | RasPi GPIO Pin        |
|----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|

### TEST, BUILD & PUSH

Refer to
[ci-README.md](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/ci-README.md)
on how I automated this process.

#### STEP 1 - TEST

The following steps are located in
[unit-tests.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/tree/master/code/test/unit-tests.sh).

To unit test the code,

```bash
cd code
go test -cover ./... | tee test/test_coverage.txt
cat test/test_coverage.txt
```

To create `_test` files,

```bash
gotests -w -all main.go
```

#### STEP 2 - BUILD (DOCKER IMAGE VIA DOCKERFILE)

The following steps are located in
[build.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/build-push/build.sh).

We will be using a multi-stage build using a
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/build-push/Dockerfile).
The end result will be a very small docker image around 13MB.

```bash
cd code
docker build -f build-push/Dockerfile -t jeffdecola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver .
```

You can check and test this docker image,

```bash
docker images jeffdecola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver:latest
docker run --name control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver -dit jeffdecola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver
docker exec -i -t control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver /bin/bash
docker logs control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver
```

##### Stage 1

In stage 1, rather than copy a binary into a docker image (because
that can cause issue), **the Dockerfile will build the binary in the
docker image.**

If you open the DockerFile you can see it will get the dependencies and
build the binary in go,

```bash
FROM golang:alpine AS builder
RUN go get -d -v
RUN go build -o /go/bin/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver main.go
```

##### Stage 2

In stage 2, the Dockerfile will copy the binary created in
stage 1 and place into a smaller docker base image based
on `alpine`, which is around 13MB.

#### STEP 3 - PUSH (TO DOCKERHUB)

The following steps are located in
[push.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver/blob/master/code/build-push/push.sh).

If you are not logged in, you need to login to dockerhub,

```bash
docker login
```

Once logged in you can push to DockerHub,

```bash
docker push jeffdecola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver
```

Check the
[control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeffdecola/control-fpga-via-raspi-and-webserver)
docker image at DockerHub.
